## Crowdfunding Platform

### I have considered following tables:

1. Projects - For all the fields related to project specific details
2. Project Types - To tag project by type i.e. currently it says building
3. Project Donations - To store all the donor details, as it can have more than one donor
4. Project Updates - To store all the updates, as it can have more than updates
5. Project Images - To store all the images, as one project can have one or many images to display as a gallery

### I have created APIs for all the above.


### Working postman collection with environment for all the above APIs.
